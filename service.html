                        I occassionaly go to blood drives sponsored by different organizations around the school, <br>
                        this is because I have had family members who needed blood transfusions, and thus know <br>
                        how hard it is to get blood sometimes. Therefore I try to help as much as I can, because luckily <br>
                        I am in good health and can afford to. <br>

                        Big Event is a tradition around campus where students help to clean up not only campus, <br>
                        but the surrounding areas as well. Different organizatiosn can take different responsibilities <br>
                        and it is super awesome to see everyone in the school coming together for a great cause. <br>

                        Swap shop is a really cool opportunity for Texas A&M students to recycle old things, <br>
                        that they do not use anymore, and exchange them for other items that students did not want. <br>
                        My role in this was to not only help set up event, but help bring people from the community <br>
                        to the event. If you are affiliated with Texas A&M check out this link: (placeholder need to update): <a href="google.com">Click Here!</a>
