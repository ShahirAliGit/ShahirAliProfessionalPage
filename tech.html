                        This was a project where we had to create a vending machine in Java. <br>
                        The front end was made using JavaFX and the backend was made using Java, <br>
                        making sure to use basic OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. <br>\
                        For me the hardest part was the frontend design using JavaFX. <br>

                        Due to the nature of the internship I can not talk about the project much, <br>
                        However I can say that I learned a lot to do with satellites and digital <br>
                        signal processing using the SoapySDR interface in C++, along with most of my <br>
                        technical skills such as Git, Linux, and Docker, overall a super fun and interesting <br>
                        experience, and I can not wait to be back in the Summer! <br>

                        This project was something I was not familiar with and was a challenge for me <br>
                        The idea of the project was to rasterize different images in different ways, <br>
                        such as random colors, grayscale, and color gradients. I got to use OpenGL for <br>
                        generation of the images, however I still consider myself not very familiar with <br>
                        the technology. It was a really fun project, and I would like to explore it again <br>
                        in the future, though it is not high on my priority list. <br>
